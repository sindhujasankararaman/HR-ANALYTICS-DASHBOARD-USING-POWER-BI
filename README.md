# Project Overview: 
Business success isn’t just about attracting new customers; it’s about ensuring that those who have purchased once choose to return. I developed a Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to gain clear insights into Customer Repeat Value (CRV) and the key factors influencing it. This metric empowers businesses to fine-tune their strategies, boost customer loyalty, and ultimately increase lifetime customer value and overall revenue.
# ✅ Recommendations:
Enhance Successful Referral Campaigns

Double down on referral-based marketing, which proved highly effective.

Consider introducing tiered referral incentives to encourage more participation.

Reassess Email Promotions

Audit the performance of email campaigns—review content, subject lines, send times, and targeting.


Capitalize on Summer Trends

Since summer had the highest repeat rate (30.4%), consider launching key promotions or loyalty drives during this season.

Analyze what worked in summer and apply those tactics in other seasons.

Address Spring Slump

Investigate the drop in repeat rate during spring (29.1%)—review customer feedback, product offerings, and campaign strategies during this period.

Experiment with exclusive spring offers or re-engagement campaigns.

Segment and Personalize Retention Efforts

Use the interactive dashboard to drill down into monthly repeat rates and identify customer segments with higher/lower loyalty.

Tailor campaigns to specific segments based on their behavior and preferences.

Improve Customer Experience

Pair quantitative data with qualitative insights (e.g., reviews, surveys) to identify pain points affecting repeat purchases.

Enhance post-purchase support, product quality, or delivery experience if needed.

Monitor KPIs Continuously

Establish benchmarks for repeat customer rate and campaign ROI.

Use the dashboard regularly to track changes over time and adjust strategies dynamically.
