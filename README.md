# Project Overview: 
Business success isnâ€™t just about attracting new customers; itâ€™s about ensuring that those who have purchased once choose to return. To support this, I developed a Power BI dashboard that provides stakeholders with clear insights into Customer Repeat Value (CRV) and the key factors influencing it. This metric empowers businesses to fine-tune their strategies, enhance customer loyalty, and ultimately increase both lifetime customer value and overall revenue.
# Introduction and Situation
This project was initiated in response to a strategic request from the Director of Customer Engagement, seeking a deeper, data-driven understanding of repeat customer behavior to support upcoming growth initiatives. While anecdotal evidence indicated that repeat purchases play a significant role in the companyâ€™s revenue, there was no systematic analysis available to validate these insights or uncover detailed patterns.
The goal of this project is to analyze monthly and seasonal trends in repeat purchases, measure the contribution of repeat customers to overall sales, and evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns on encouraging customer loyalty. By leveraging transaction and campaign data, the analysis aims to provide clear, actionable insights that will help optimize customer engagement strategies, improve campaign effectiveness, and ultimately drive sustainable business growth
# Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
# Data Preparation and Visualization Approach
To ensure the accuracy and quality of the analysis, I utilized Power Query within Power BI for comprehensive data cleaning and transformation. This process involved:

Removing duplicates and handling missing values

Formatting and standardizing date and categorical fields

Merging and shaping datasets such as customer transactions, campaign data, and regional information

Creating calculated columns and measures to support analysis

For the visualization and insights delivery, I leveraged Power BIâ€™s rich visualization capabilities to build interactive dashboards that illustrate:

Monthly and seasonal trends in repeat customer purchases

Geographic distribution of repeat customer rates and orders

The impact of marketing campaigns on repeat purchase behavior

Key metrics like repeat customer rate, sales contribution, and purchase frequency

This combination of Power Query for data preparation and Power BI for visualization enabled a seamless end-to-end analytics workflow, providing clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.
# Business Questions
I have delved deep into the data to answer the following business questions
What is the total size of our customer base, and how many of them are repeat customers?

What percentage of our customers are repeat buyers, and how does this reflect on our customer loyalty?

How does the repeat customer rate vary across different time periods, such as months and seasons?

Are there regional differences in the repeat customer rate that we should be aware of?

How do repeat customers contribute to overall sales volume and revenue compared to new customers?

What marketing efforts have been most effective in driving repeat purchases within this customer base?

# ðŸ“– Insights and Recommendations:

Out of a total of 5,000 customers, 1,474 returned for at least one more purchase, resulting in a repeat customer rate of 29.5%. 

The summer season stood out, achieving the highest repeat customer rate at 30.4%, suggesting successful engagement and possible season-specific strategies worth replicating. On the other hand, spring had the lowest repeat rate at 29.1%, signaling an opportunity to improve our customer experience or promotional efforts during that period.

Referral-based marketing campaigns performed exceptionally well, attracting a significant number of repeat customers, highlighting the power of word-of-mouth and peer influence. In contrast, email promotions showed minimal impact, indicating the need to re-evaluate or refresh our email marketing strategy.

This story not only sheds light on current performance but also provides a roadmap for targeted, data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and boost long-term value.
