# Project Overview: 
Business success isnâ€™t just about attracting new customers; itâ€™s about ensuring that those who have purchased once choose to return. I developed a Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to gain clear insights into Customer Repeat Value (CRV) and the key factors influencing it. This metric empowers businesses to fine-tune their strategies, boost customer loyalty, and ultimately increase lifetime customer value and overall revenue.

In a competitive market, customer retention is just as critical as customer acquisition. Our latest analysis, visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, dives deep into understanding repeat customer behavior.

Out of a total of 5,000 customers, 1,474 returned for at least one more purchase, resulting in a repeat customer rate of 29.5%. While this rate gives us a strong baseline for loyalty, the trends across seasons reveal deeper insights.

The summer season stood out, achieving the highest repeat customer rate at 30.4%, suggesting successful engagement and possible season-specific strategies worth replicating. On the other hand, spring had the lowest repeat rate at 29.1%, signaling an opportunity to improve our customer experience or promotional efforts during that period.

To support deeper exploration, the dashboard is fully interactiveâ€”users can hover over visuals and drill down by month, season, or year, enabling customized insights based on temporal trends.

Campaign analysis further revealed valuable findings. Referral-based marketing campaigns performed exceptionally well, attracting a significant number of repeat customers, highlighting the power of word-of-mouth and peer influence. In contrast, email promotions showed minimal impact, indicating the need to re-evaluate or refresh our email marketing strategy.

This story not only sheds light on current performance but also provides a roadmap for targeted, data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and boost long-term value.
